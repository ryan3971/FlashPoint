    <string name="explination">At this point you have likely discovered that this game
         is a lot harder then it initially appears. This is because this game takes advantage
          of the flash lag effect. The flash lag effect is a visual phenomenon wherein a flash
           and a moving object that appear in the same location are perceived to be displaced
            from one another. The effect can however be compensated for with practice. Several
             explanations for this simple illusion have been explored in the neuroscience literature
              but it is not yet fully understood.</string>
